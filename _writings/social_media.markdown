Do not use social media. Even though there are good use cases and good people on these platforms, it's impossible to use them in a healthy way. The algorithm will keep you hooked one way or another. Hate, rage and sensationalism. Extreme personalities. Unrealistic ideals. Jealousy. Clickbait.

Stay away, not worth it.
