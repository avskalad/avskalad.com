title:  "Avoid ads & \"ads\""

They exploit your attention. They manipulate you and track your behavior. They pollute the environment around you with clutter. Ads should be avoided and you should loathe them.

Don't watch TV or listen to radio where you're forced to see & hear ads. Don't read magazines with every second page being payed content. Do not under any circumstance let your children be targeted by advertisers or let them get accustomed to "skipping ads" in every app they use.

There's also "ads" which some argue are not real ads (but they are). It's every streaming service now having "trailers" and "promos" for other shows that play before the thing you actually want to watch. It's the influencer pretending to like something with a hidden agenda.

Pay for the content you enjoy. Avoid the rest. Don't accept or normalize ads. Use ad-blockers in your browser or use a DNS sinkholes.
