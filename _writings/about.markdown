title:  "What's this about?"
---

I got fed up with the default behaviors seen in my life.
Children losing their attention span by staring at screens all day.
Partners becoming depressed, overweight and obsessed with imaginary lives on Instagram.
People getting so stressed over their jobs that they (literally) lost all their hair.

_There are two kinds of people in the modern world: exhausted and liars._

But I also grew frustrated about everyone just complaining about how bad everything is.
The goal of this site is to create a framework for myself to live by.
Hopefully others will benefit from it as well.

The site will be a living document, updated over time. At first it will be a draft bullet point list, some points expanded upon with links. Others to be expanded later, or removed if I change my mind. As of now, think about it as an early first draft.

Most importantly, the things on this site should be actionable. It's not about highlighting a problem or wishing for a future utopian solution---every bullet point should have something that can be applied right now. 

I won't link to any other sites or cite any sources---and I will never recommend a product or service. Everything will be in general terms, and you can choose how to apply it in a way that makes sense for your context. 

Everything on this site is human centric. The internet is to a large extent ruined by AI generated trash. What you get here is pure "hand-made" content made by a real human. It may be rough and grammatically incorrect, but at least it's real.

## What about "avskalad"
It's a Swedish word. The verb **skala** ("to peel") and the prefix **av-** ("off" or "away"), literally "peeled off". But the figurative meaning is stripped-down, simple, minimalist, bare.

In a way I want to peel off all the bad parts and focus on what's important. But also, since domain names are so cheap there are almost no available ones to register anymore. Avskalad was up for grabs---not everything needs a deeper meaning.
