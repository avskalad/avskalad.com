title:  "What's this about?"
---

I got fed up with the default behaviors seen in my life.
Children losing their attention span by staring at screens all day.
Partners becoming depressed, overweight and obsessed with imaginary lives on Instagram.
People getting so stressed over their jobs that they (literally) lose all their hair.

_There are two kinds of people in the modern world: exhausted and liars._

But I also grew frustrated about everyone just complaining about how bad everything is.
The goal of this site is to create a framework for myself to live by.
Hopefully others will benefit from it as well.

The site will be a living document, updated over time. At first it will be a draft bullet point list, some points expanded upon with links. Others to be expanded later, or removed if I change my mind. As of now, think about it as an early first draft.

Most importantly, the things on this site should be actionable. It's not about highlighting a problem or wishing for a future utopian solution---every bullet point should be something that can be done right now.

Everything on this site is human centric. The internet is to a large degree ruined by AI generated trash. What you get here is pure "hand-made" content made by a real human.

## What about "avskalad"
It's a Swedish word. The verb **skala** ("to peel") and the prefix **av-** ("off" or "away"), literally "peeled off". But the figurative meaning is stripped-down, simple, minimalist, bare.

In a way I want to peel off all the bad parts. But also, since domain names are so cheap there are almost no available ones to register anymore. Avskalad was up for grabs---not everything needs a deeper meaning.
