title:  "What's this about?"
---

I got fed up with the default behavior in my life.
My children started losing their attention span by staring at screens all day.
My partner became depressed, overweight and looked at imaginary lives on Instagram all day.
Several persons close to me got so stressed over their jobs that they literally lost their hair.

_There are two kinds of people in the modern world: exhausted and liars._

But I also grew frustrated about everyone just complaining about how bad everything is.
The goal of this site is to create a framework for myself to live by.
Hopefully others will benefit from it as well.

The site will be a living document, updated over time. At first it will be a draft bullet point list, some points expanded upon with links. Others to be expanded later, or removed. As of now, think about it as a very early first draft.

Most importantly, the things on this site should be actionable. It's not about highlighting a problem or wishing for a future utopian solution---every bullet point should be something that can be done right now.

## What about "avskalad"
It's a Swedish word. The verb **skala** ("to peel") and the prefix **av-** ("off" or "away"), literally "peeled off". But the figurative meaning is stripped-down, simple, minimalist, bare.

In a way I want to peel off all the bad parts. But also, since domain names are so cheap there are almost no available ones to register anymore. Avskalad was up for grabs---not everything needs a deeper meaning.
