title:  "Quality"
---

Buying things with good quality is not an easy task. It's been a race to the bottom in cost cutting efforts and planned obsolescence. Whole categories of products don't have quality options anymore. But some do. [Curation]({% link _writings/curation.markdown %}) can sometimes help you find them.

It can be impossible to compare products based on their features. Once I had to pick between two laundry machines. I made the decision based on two facts: the one I picked was twice as heavy as the other one and it was not manufactured by a publicly listed company. It has worked well so far but it may have been pure luck.

Brands can not always be trusted. Some are good at distinguishing their budget vs premium lines. Others produce quality items but will also buy poor quality options and slap their own brand on it and sell as their own to compete in all price ranges. (And many companies sell poorly made trash all the time.)

Look at the warranty (length & scope). Make sure the product is repairable and that spare parts are readily available (check for older, even discontinued models). Find out what the professionals and enthusiasts prefer when applicable---but make sure they are real and trustworthy.

I would've liked to say that you should look for things like "craftsmanship" and "pride in quality" but these words have lost their meaning. Marketing is better than ever at fooling us---be cautious! Don't judge on looks or feel alone.
