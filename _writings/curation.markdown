title:  "Curation"
---

The internet is flooded with AI generated, SEO optimized trash. Text, images---even fake people. Nothing is real anymore and the quality of information is beyond terrible. Search engines doesn't work anymore. It will likely just get worse.

Trying to compare and evaluate goods when shopping is almost impossible. The same TV can have different model numbers in different store. New models every year make long term reviews impossible. If you search for "water bottle" at one of the big online stores you get a million subtly different versions produced by random-character named companies you've never heard of. Ratings doesn't really help.

Curation by someone you trust is more important than ever. Algorithms won't work; you need a human who actually cares about finding the good stuff. Ask people who actually know what they're talking about for help. People who know [quality]({% link _writings/quality.markdown %}).

Buy products from stores with a limited curated selection of good, vetted items. Don't buy from the big marketplaces that will sell you literally anything remotely sellable.
